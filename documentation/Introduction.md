**IMPORTANT NOTICE:**  
We stopped producing and selling MasterDataTool in favour of a cooperation with HALL AUDIO. The direct MDT successor is the "ML Streamer Tinker Edition" and a fully integrated plug-and-play solution is marketed under "ML Streamer". Both were developed togehter with Hall Audio and are sold by them directly and their distributors / retailers.

MasterDataTool is an audio and communication interface for vintage B&O HiFi devices. Many of their design classics between 1980 to around 2012 do feature a special multiroom connector.

Given the age of those units, multiroom audio distribution was something not seen often. So unlike nowadays where almost everything is IP-based back then they were using proprietary serial communication interfaces along with analog audio transmission.

Due to their timeless design and often high engineering effort those speakers and music systems from back then are still an object of desire to many individuals. Unfortunately, they are technically outdated.

To overcome this we engineered a little adapter that will make use of their proprietary MasterLink or Datalink multiroom interface and so retrofit them with modern streaming technologies. The clever engineering done in the old days enables this adapter to integrate perfectly and enable a native UX feeling.

Our target was to keep the final cost of this product low and also give customers the chance to alter the software to their own needs. So the decision was made to release this adapter as an interface that is compatible with single-board computers coming in the Raspberry Pi form factor.

We do provide documentation of the MasterLink and DataLink communication protocols and maintain a few basic software examples to get you started quickly. You will quickly learn how to enable streaming compatibility on some well-sounding and good-looking active speakers or music systems. You don't have to physically modify them and keep using the original remote or buttons on the product itself. Also, some music systems will even display metadata like song titles and album names.

PolyVection is an embedded engineering company with a focus on developing Linux-running hardware from scratch. We made the MasterDataTool Raspberry Pi compatible to make it easier for people without an engineering background. It is a spin-off version of our "[Universal Link Adapter](https://polyvection.com/showcase/uba/)" we did as a showcase project. People kept asking us about selling it hence we released this much easier-to-maintain lite version.
